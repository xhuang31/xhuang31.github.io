<p>Our current research interests include Graph Neural Networks, Knowledge Graphs, Network Anomaly Detection, Recommender Systems, Automated Machine Learning.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Attributed Network Learning</b>. Networks are widely adopted to represent the relations between objects in many disciplines. In real-world scenarios, nodes are often associated with a rich set of data describing their characteristics. We model these systems as attributed networks. Our goal is to develop effective, scalable, and human-centric learning algorithms for attributed networks, to enable their actionable patterns to be easily accessible and interpretable to data consumers.
</p></li>
<li><p><b>Knowledge Graphs</b>. Knowledge graphs (KGs) are an efficient data structure characterizing relations among real-world entities. They have served as an essential ingredient in an increasing number of applications, such as search, recommendations, question answering, and conversational agents. There are considerable KGs available or emerging, such as Wikidata and COVID-19 event KGs. To effectively utilize and integrate these KGs, many challenges need to be addressed. Real-world KGs could contain millions or billions of facts, associated with distinct types of auxiliary information. A significant number of incorrect facts could be introduced during the construction of KGs. Our goal is to develop effective, scalable, and human-centric embedding and refinement algorithms for KGs, to enable their actionable patterns to be easily accessible to data consumers.</p></li>
