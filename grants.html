<h2>Data &amp; Codes</h2>

  <li><p><b>Attributed network learning</b>. Networks are widely adopted to represent the relations between objects in many disciplines. In real-world scenarios, nodes are often associated with a rich set of data describing their characteristics. We model these systems as attributed networks. Our goal is to develop effective, scalable, and human-centric learning algorithms for attributed networks, to enable their actionable patterns to be easily accessible and interpretable to data consumers.

</li>
  <li><p><b>Knowledge graphs</b>. A knowledge graph (KG) consists of numerous triples, in which each triple, i.e., (head entity, relation, tail entity), denotes an assertion. By embedding KGs into low-dimensional representations, we could integrate them into deep learning models to perform various tasks, such as search and recommendation. However, real-world KGs often contain many false assertions, which were inevitably injected during the construction of KGs. We propose to investigate error-aware KG learning to eliminate the impact of errors on KG-based systems.</p>
